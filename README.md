***Breast Cancer Pipeline***

This project aims to build an ML pipeline that automatically runs every hour using Mage AI. The pipeline reads data for cancer patients, splits it into training and testing sets, scales the data, trains a logistic regression model, stores and displays the results on MLflow, and finally deploys the model using FastAPI.
